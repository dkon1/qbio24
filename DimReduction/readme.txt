For dimensionality reduction projects

Note: For the mean fluorescence data, it is organized in a nCells x nDirections x nFrames matrix. The first dimension is cells, the second dimension is directions, and the third dimension is frames. The number in each entry is the mean fluorescence, averaged across trials. If you have questions about the details, please ask me! – Matthew
